# switch-.uf2-files
Want .uf2 files for your switch hacking needs? ask and link to the .bin payload you want and I may get to it in my free time. I under stand many don't want to learn to do it them selves but I did and I am willing to help. (mainly ment for the https://github.com/euclala/RCM_typeC_ex dongle but I'm almost sure that it will work for any dongle and/or internal mod)


If you want to learn to build your own uf2 files you can follow this guide

Requirements

Python 3.x.x (needed)

Arduino IDE (with the required archives, info taken from euclala's repository
