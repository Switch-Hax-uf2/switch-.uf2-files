# switch-.uf2-files
Want .uf2 files for your switch hacking needs? ask and link to the .bin payload you want and I may get to it in my free time. I under stand many don't want to learn to do it them selves but I did and I am willing to help. (mainly ment for the https://github.com/euclala/RCM_typeC_ex dongle but I'm almost sure that it will work for any dongle and/or internal mod)
